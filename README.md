# Tile Polygon Snapper for Godot 4.X

This is an editor plugin for [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) v4.X that allows custom snapping polygon vertices while editing tileset.
It can help you until [custom snapping](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/73495) appeared in new version

Unfortunately, there is a [typo](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/73887) in current Godot 4.RC master. I hope the fix will be included in next RC version.

To work with this plugin you can download fixed Godot4 build from [fix pull-request page](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/73887/checks)

## Installation

Simply download it from [Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1683)

Alternatively, download or clone this repository and copy the contents of the `addons` folder to your own project's `addons` folder. Then enable the plugin on the Project Settings.
